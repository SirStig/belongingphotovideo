## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd belongingphotovideo
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Demo mode in builds

You can enable demo mode at build time so the production bundle runs with the sample/demo content.

- Locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:VITE_DEMO = 'true'; npm run build
```

- In CI (the included GitHub Actions workflow) the demo flag is already set so the deployed site will run in demo mode.

When `VITE_DEMO` is set to `true` the app will initialize the CMS in demo mode. If you set it to `false`, production/localStorage-backed mode will be used instead.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` that will build the site and deploy the `dist` output to GitHub Pages when you push to `main`.

- What the workflow does:
	- Installs dependencies
	- Builds the site with `GH_PAGES=true` and `VITE_DEMO=true` (so the built site uses the repo base and demo mode)
	- Uploads the `dist` artifact and deploys it to GitHub Pages

- To deploy manually (locally), build with the GH_PAGES env and then push the `dist` contents to your GitHub Pages branch (or let the workflow do it):

```powershell
$env:GH_PAGES = 'true'; $env:VITE_DEMO = 'true'; npm run build
# then upload the contents of ./dist to your gh-pages branch (or rely on the workflow)
```

The Vite config reads `process.env.GH_PAGES` and sets the `base` to `/belongingphotovideo/` when true; that ensures assets and routing work correctly on GitHub Pages.

## Key Features

### Demo Mode
The application includes a demo mode that showcases the design and functionality with sample data. This allows clients to see the website in action before adding their real content.

### Hidden Routes
Wedding portfolios are accessible via direct URLs (`/weddings`) but are not linked in the main navigation, allowing the business to focus on branding while still showcasing wedding work to interested clients.

### Responsive Design
The website is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Desktop (1024px+)
- Large screens (1280px+)

### SEO Optimization
- Dynamic meta tags for each page
- Open Graph and Twitter Card support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Optimized images with alt text
- Clean URLs and proper heading hierarchy

## Admin Panel

Access the admin panel at `/admin` to:
- View dashboard statistics
- Manage content (demo)
- View album management interface
- Toggle between demo and production modes

**Note**: In production, this would integrate with Google OAuth for secure authentication.

## Future Enhancements

- Google OAuth integration for admin authentication
- Cloud image storage and upload functionality
- Advanced album management with drag-and-drop
- Email contact form integration
- Analytics and performance tracking
- Blog/news section
- Client gallery access with password protection
